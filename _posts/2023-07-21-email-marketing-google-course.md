# Week 1: Introduction to think outside the inbox: email marketing
## What is email marketing
## Prepare for your campaign
**PESTLE vs SWOT**

- A SWOT audit identifies a company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

- A PESTLE audit identifies political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors that may affect your email marketing strategy.

## Build your email marketing strategy 

There is no one way to create an email marketing strategy. You can record strategy on a paper using a writing utensil. Or, you can use a word processing application like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Instead, it’s more important to include steps commonly found in other successful strategies. The sections of an email marketing strategy include:
- Set your goals
- Choose an email marketing provider 
- Build your email marketing subscriber list
- Evaluate brand guidelines 
- Determine email frequency 
- Determine performance measuring methods 

Let’s explore each of these steps one by one.

1. Set your goals

The first step of creating an email marketing strategy is defining your email goals. These goals are often in line with your business goals, meaning your emails will work to achieve the goals that you have for your business. 

Some common goals include: 
- Increase brand visibility
- Increase website traffic
- Increase sales
- Acquire new customers
- Build relationships with existing customers
- Increase brand loyalty and loyal customers

Defining your email marketing goal first will help guide you when choosing relevant email options in the upcoming strategy steps. 

2. Choose an email marketing provider 

An email marketing provider, or email marketing service, is a company that offers email marketing or bulk email services. Choosing the right email marketing provider can significantly impact the success of your email campaign. Some popular email marketing providers are:
- Mailchimp
- HubSpot
- Salesforce
- Constant Contact

When deciding which service is best for your brand, you will need to consider the following factors:
- Cost
- Deliverability
- Reporting
- Email list management
- Template features

3. Build your email marketing subscriber list

Next, determine how you will build and maintain an engaged subscriber list. Building email lists is an ongoing process. To build an email list, you can:

    Create a signup form on your website

    Create an in-person sign up list

    Share a signup form on social media 

Once you create a signup list, you’ll be able to divide it into smaller groups based on criteria like interests, location, or purchase history, in a process known as segmentation. This will help you target specific groups for specific goals. 

4. Evaluate brand guidelines 

When a business wants to establish a distinctive brand identity, they often create a list of rules and standards that convey how their brand should be represented. These rules are the company’s brand guidelines and they apply to all content produced by the company, including emails. 

In your email marketing strategy, identify specific brand guidelines that will be relevant to your email marketing campaigns. These guidelines can include the following:
- Fonts
- Colors
- Layouts
- Illustrations
- Logos
If your email marketing service allows you to create templates for your emails, you can apply specific guideline details for all your brand’s outgoing emails for a consistent brand identity. 
5. Determine email frequency

Stating how often your emails will be shared will help you plan out how often your emails will reach your subscribers. Later in the course, you will learn more about how to establish email frequency and how to create a schedule for sending emails. 
6. Determine performance measuring methods 

When you begin your email marketing campaigns, you’ll need to analyze the success of your campaigns. The tools you’ll use are based on your available resources. Most email marketing providers offer basic reporting that tracks essential metrics like how many of your emails were opened, unsubscribers, and click through rate (CTR). Some providers also monitor bounce rate, which is the percentage of emails that have not successfully reached recipients. You can also run a deliverability check that determines if your emails are getting to their intended recipients.

Be sure to state in your email marketing strategy which of these tools will be most effective for analyzing your campaign success. Also be sure to state when you plan to collect and evaluate these performance measuring methods. 
Key takeaways  

Outlining the steps and procedures of an email marketing strategy can help you develop a successful, organized, and well-thought email marketing campaign. These steps will guide you as you strive to create emails that achieve your marketing goals.

## Craft catchy newsletter copy

Writing marketing emails is something that takes a lot of practice and patience. You won’t learn every skill you need to be a professional writer in this program, but you can use these tips to ensure you’re setting yourself up for success when crafting emails.  
1. Write to add value

As a digital marketer, your goal is to convince people to open, read, and click on the links in your marketing emails. To achieve this goal, write content they will want to engage with. Every email you send should add value to the subscriber in some way. Whether you’re introducing them to new products or services, making them laugh, or teaching them something new, each element in your emails needs to be thoughtful and intentional.
Subject line

A subject line is the first text recipients see after your name when an email reaches their inbox.The subject line is your subscribers’ first impression of the email, so it’s important to make it compelling. 

When you write your subject line:

- Keep it brief. Your subject line should be about 6-10 words total. If it’s too long, it may be cut off from being viewed entirely by your subscribers. 

- Pique readers’ curiosity. Write a subject line that makes readers interested in the content of your email. If you’re sending emails to a list of people who added items to their cart but abandoned it at some point during the checkout process, you might include a subject line like: “These items are too good to leave in your cart.”

- If you’re offering something, be clear about it. Whether it’s an experience, a new piece of information, a discount, or something else, make sure subscribers know there is a benefit to opening your email.

- Consider personalizing it. If you use an email marketing tool, you will have the capability to personalize emails by using first names. This is a great way for subscribers to feel like you’re talking to them specifically. Depending on which tool you use, the way you do this will be a little bit different, so read up on your specific tool. 

2. Preview text

Preview text is another important aspect of your marketing emails. Preview text is next to an email’s subject line in the inbox and gives extra insight into what’s inside the email. It may be secondary to your subject line, but it’s still visible from readers’ inboxes; they see it before they click into your email. Your preview text tells readers exactly what to expect in opening the email.

When you write preview text:

- Make sure to include the most important piece of information from your email. What is the main point you are attempting to communicate? That should be your preview text.   

- Make sure it aligns with what your subject line says. The subject line and preview text should work together to entice subscribers to open the email. 

- Sometimes, you may want to maintain a sense of mystery. Writing preview text that teases the content can be an effective way to get readers to open an email. Preview text  like: “The recipe you didn’t know you needed…” might be an effective way to make your subscribers curious about the contents of your email. Before you do this, think about your goals and objectives and whether this makes sense for your brand.

- Keep it between 35-50 characters. Your preview text should be brief enough that your subscribers can read it quickly.

3. Body 

The email body is where most of your content will be. You can test out different approaches when it comes to your email body, because what is right for other companies may not be right for you. 

When writing your body:

- Maintain a second person perspective. This means you will always want to write your emails as though you are speaking to your subscribers. You want the email to seem personal and specifically crafted for your readers. Second person—also referred to as “you” language—helps create a sense that the writer is talking directly to you, the reader. This makes readers feel engaged and involved. A phrase like “Here’s a discount for you,” is more powerful than “Here’s a discount for our readers.”

- When possible, break up blocks of text with white space. You don’t want your email to seem overwhelming to the reader, so be brief and include visual breaks in between your text. 

- Include a compelling call to action. Your readers are more likely to do what you ask of them if you ask them clearly. If you want them to buy an item, encourage them to do exactly that. Sometimes, emails will have several calls to action—especially in newsletters, where several products, services, or links are likely being shared.

4. Key takeaways

Writing compelling content is a huge part of email marketing, and it takes time to get it right. If you follow the tips provided here, you’ll have a much better chance at growing your open rates.
