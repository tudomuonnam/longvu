Hello and welcome to my page!

My name is Long (vuduc.long), and I am a passionate professional with a diverse background. I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering, but for the last 10 years, I have been working in sales. While I have enjoyed my time in sales, I have always had a keen interest in the IT field, and I am excited to transition to this new career path.

Over the past few years, I have taken the initiative to learn about various aspects of IT, including Operating systems, Version control, running and managing dedicated servers, and deploying services. I am confident in my ability to tackle the challenges that come with working in the IT field, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this area.

As I transition to this new career path, I am looking for opportunities to work as a System operator, IT help desk, or DevOps professional. I am eager to put my skills and knowledge to work, and I am committed to being a valuable team member who contributes to the success of the organization.

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and engaging in various hobbies. I am an avid reader, and I enjoy trekking and running to stay active and healthy. I am also a proud parent to a 2-year-old son who brings joy and excitement to my life.

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals in the IT field. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
