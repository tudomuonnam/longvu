## Course 1:
Earn, Own, Paid media.
### Earn media
Earned media is important to businesses because it relies on word-of-mouth promotion from friends, family, unpaid influencer posts, product reviews and so much more. If someone likes your product enough to post about it for free, not only are you not spending anything to get that positive publicity, but it also means your audience believes in you. It’s probably the most difficult marketing tactic to be successful at because you have no control over it. Some examples are:

- Customer testimonials and reviews
- Blog posts about your product
- Shares and reposts of your content
- Mentions of your product on social pages
**Effective earned media strategy**

Although you can’t necessarily control earned media, there are steps you can take to set yourself up for possible shares, reposts, mentions, positive reviews, and more. The most important thing when it comes to earned media is to create engaging content. The more engaging your content is, the more likely your audience is to share it. Next, nurture relationships you may have with other brands, media members, and journalists. If you do this successfully, your brand may get positive press as a result. Next, make sure you are providing more than satisfactory customer service to your customers. When your audience is enjoying their journey as followers, customers, users— or whatever their relationship may be to you—they are likely to share your brand with others. And finally, encourage others within your organization to share, share, share. The more people you have sharing your content, the more others will see it, and the more likely they are to share it. 

### Real-time marketing

The news cycle in the age of social media is fast-paced and ever-changing. A story might break on Twitter and—in what feels like an instant—the discussion might suddenly end. In this reading, you’ll learn how to market in real time so that your content remains fresh and interesting to your audience as the news cycle on social media changes.

**The importance of real-time marketing**

Real-time marketing (RTM) is marketing that is happening in real time. RTM is often implemented on social media because of how quickly commentary and engagement takes place there. If millions of users are talking about a big story on social media, brands will want to be a part of the conversation in an attempt to boost engagement. Capitalizing on these moments can have a huge payoff for brands that do it right. Real-time marketing is an opportunity for companies to connect with their audiences and position their brand wherever they want in certain discussions. So, the question is, what does it take for a brand to effectively market in real time?

**Effective RTM**

Effective RTM can be incredibly powerful for your brand. To successfully market in real time, your content must be:

- Relevant: What is happening right now? What is most of the discussion about on social media at this very moment?

- Clever: How can you package your content in a way that shows your brand’s personality and wit?

- Fresh: If the trending topic happened Wednesday and you weren’t able to turn around a piece of content until Thursday, is it still fresh enough to get engagement?

- On-target: Is this trending topic or current event of interest to your audience?

- Attention-grabbing: What will it take for people to see your post, stop scrolling, and engage with it immediately?

**RTM strategies**

Now that you have an idea of what makes a real-time post engaging, follow these tactics to capitalize on trends and successfully market in real time:

Always be listening. A company’s social media manager will typically be the first to know about trends that are relevant to any real-time marketing plans, so keeping communication open with the social team is important. If you are a member of the social team, aim to be present on social media as often as possible so you can catch any trending topics that might be worth capitalizing on.

Use your brand’s resources. If you have a design team and a copyediting team, enlist their help to create quick, clever posts of the highest quality possible.

Leverage social media influencers. If your brand partners with social media influencers, ask them to help amplify your RTM assets by reposting them or interacting with them.

Know where the conversation is happening. There will be moments that happen on one social media platform that may not be a topic of discussion on others. Make sure you engage in the conversation where people are talking about it.

Promote some of your posts. Since algorithms determine when and to whom your organic posts are shown on different platforms, your RTM post may not reach a large enough audience in time to still be relevant using organic means alone. This could be a good opportunity to promote the post to generate more engagement and potential new followers. A promoted post is a social media post that you pay the platform to make more visible.
Key takeaways

Social media users can become desensitized to current events and trending topics quickly because of the fast-paced nature of the news cycle. The best way to stay relevant and boost engagement is to capitalize on those moments through real-time marketing. Aim to create content that your audience will find relevant, clever, fresh, on-target, and attention-grabbing.

**How to response people on social media**
- If you are responding to positive feedback, acknowledge the comment, thank them for the kind words, and consider reposting or Retweeting their feedback. It says a lot about your brand when people provide positive feedback about it on social media, so it’s a good strategy to ensure as many people as possible see that feedback.

- If you are responding to questions or general feedback, reply briefly and with clear enthusiasm. Engaging with customers should be fun and informative for both parties, and your customers should be able to tell you’re having fun based on the type of responses you give. Don’t be afraid to use creative language and exclamation marks, if it aligns with your brand voice. 

- If you are responding to negative comments, such as when you have to resolve an issue for users, it’s best to remain calm and use helpful, polite, and approachable language. If there is a clear issue that has the potential to become something larger, you may have to offer refunds or promotional codes to make things right. In these situations, encourage them to send you a direct message so the issue can be resolved quickly and privately. However, if the response could be helpful to other people who may have the same concerns or thoughts as the original poster, you may choose to answer it publicly so everyone can benefit from the interaction. 

- If you are responding to internet trolls, the short answer is: don’t. An internet troll is a person who intentionally antagonizes others online by posting inflammatory, unnecessary, or offensive comments or other disruptive content that shouldn’t necessarily be replied to. This is typically the only time you’re encouraged not to reply to users on social media. Unfortunately, trolling is a reality of social media, and a common one at that. The more your brand grows, the more trolls you will get. If you know your brand didn’t do anything wrong, simply don’t reply. If the trolling gets worse, consider deleting the comments or hiding the replies. 
### Write for social media
